It'll be held at it's usual location (the Winking Lizard Party Center in Bedford Heights). There will be plenty of great prizes. Everyone in attendance is eligible to win... whether or not you qualify to play the tournament... but you do have to be present to win. The Second Chance Bracket remains for teams eliminated from the first round.</p>\r\n<p>Now onto the changes. We're reducing the number of tournament teams from 54 to 32. This will not only make the tournament an hour and a half shorter, but it will also reduce the number of no-shows (forfeited matches) greatly. In addition to reducing the total number of tournament teams, changes have been made to the criteria involved in qualifying. The number of automatic qualifiers per store has been reduced, placing somewhat more emphasis on points and somewhat less emphasis on record. Needing to do this became obvious once we reduced the number of teams to 32. The end result is a more competitive tournament, while still ensuring that each store has adequate representation regardless of their point totals.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"tournament_qualifiers.php\">Current Tournament Qualifiers</a></strong> (and their ranking order) are available for viewing. Keep in mind... even though you might not see your name in the list, you may still qualify when the final rankings are listed. During the final week of the season, we poll all teams as to whether they plan on attending the tournament. Teams that say no are removed from the rankings and are replaced by other teams that are coming. So, don't count your team out until after the season ends and the rankings are listed as 'Final'.</p>\r\n<p>More will be posted concerning the specifics of the tournament in the next week.</p>",
